# Canoe Travel Application - Back-End #

## Overview ##
All the details of traveling can be difficult to plan and manage. Canoe is an application designed to streamline the process and reduce stress to help travelers enjoy their experience more fully. Users simply build a "Trip" in Canoe by moving through a guided sequence of steps and selecting flights, great places to eat, tourist attractions, and other points of interest from crowd-reviewed options. Upon arrival, users can then refer to Canoe to guide them on their daily activites and even add photos to help them remember and share their Trip with others.
